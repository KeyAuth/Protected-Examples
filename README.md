# Protected-Examples : Please star ðŸŒŸ

Examples on how to protect your program from reverse engineering, so that your software isn't used without authorization.

Thank you [@ghosted-oce](https://github.com/ghosted-oce)

## **Security practices**

* Utilize obfuscation provided by companies such as VMProtect or Themida (utilize their SDKs too for greater protection)
* Preform frequent integrity checks to ensure the memory of the program has not been modified
* Don't write the bytes of a file you've downloaded to disk if you don't want that file to be retrieved by the user. Rather, execute the file in memory and erase it from memory the moment execution finishes

*KeyAuth is provided in Source Code Form. The burden of client-side protection is on you the software developer, as it would be with any authentication system.*
